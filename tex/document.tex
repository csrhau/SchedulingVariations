\section{Introduction}

\section{Metric Tradeoffs}
This section introduces the various bounds which make up a POSE model.
It does so by presenting derivations of these bounds for the $Et^n$ family of metrics, along with the coordinates at which they intersect.
$Et^n$ metrics are used to introduce POSE because, despite their flaws, they remain the de-facto standard metrics for energy-aware software optimisation.
